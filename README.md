Table banking is a community-based financial model where members pool savings during regular meetings and lend funds to each other at low interest. Loans are repaid with interest, growing the collective fund. It's popular in rural and informal sectors, promoting savings, entrepreneurship, and financial inclusion in areas with limited banking services.
